📊 COVID-19 Wave Analysis

🧾 Project Overview
This project aims to analyze the spread dynamics of COVID-19 across various countries by identifying and characterizing distinct waves using time-series data. We investigate how the intensity, timing, and frequency of COVID-19 outbreaks varied over time and between countries.

🎯 Goal: Visualize Peaks, Waves, and Changes in Spread Dynamics
This goal focuses on understanding the evolution of the pandemic through various statistical and visual techniques. The following tasks were completed:

✅ Tasks Completed

Detect and count distinct waves of COVID-19 using peak detection on smoothed daily case data.

Measure wave height and duration, identifying peak values and the start-to-end span of each wave.

Calculate wave recurrence intervals to determine the time gap between consecutive wave peaks.

Compute peak-to-trough recovery times and estimate the rate of decline following each wave.

Visualize standard deviation/volatility in daily case counts to evaluate variability in spread patterns.

Compare wave patterns across countries, e.g., intense short waves vs. prolonged long waves.

📌 Key Insights from the Analysis
📈 Multiple waves were detected for most countries, with varying degrees of intensity and duration.

⏱️ Wave recurrence intervals typically ranged from 2–6 months depending on the region and public health response.

📉 Recovery times after peak infection rates showed a consistent delay, indicating the time required for effective containment.

🌍 Country-level comparisons highlighted diverse pandemic responses — some nations had short, sharp spikes, while others had broader, slower waves.

📊 High standard deviation in daily cases often corresponded with less controlled outbreaks or data inconsistencies.
